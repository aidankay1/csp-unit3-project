#### Our project guidelines
1. Write plenty of comments
	- Make them specific and descriptive
2. Write descriptive function & parameter names
	- Write as if they're for people who have never read your code before
3. Employ top-down design in your code
	- Define functions at the bottom of the code
	- Nest functions within other functions to manage complexity and readability of code
	- Most basic functions at the bottom, most abstract at the top
4. Use loops whenever possible to avoid repeated code
5. Every function that draws something (except for `dot();`) must end with `penUp();`
